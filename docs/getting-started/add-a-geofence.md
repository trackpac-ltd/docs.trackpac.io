# Add a Geofence

If your device is an asset tracker, you can add a geofence to get alerts when a tracker enters or exits and area.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Navigate to Geofences**: Locate and click the "Geofences" option in the menu to navigate to the geofences section.

2. **Click the + Arrow**: Once in the geofences section, find and click the "+" arrow, usually located at the top right corner, to create a new geofence.

3. **Enter Geofence Name**: In the fields provided, input a name for your new geofence to help you easily identify it later.

4. **Set Radius**: Use the slider or input field to set the radius of the geofence in meters.

5. **Configure Alerts**: Toggle on or off whether you want to receive alerts when the geofence boundary is crossed.

   - **Out of Hours**: Specify if you want to receive alerts only outside of certain hours.

   - **Start and End Time**: If "Out of Hours" is selected, input the time range during which you don't want to receive alerts.

6. **Select Contacts for Alerts**: Choose which of your saved contacts should receive geofence alerts by entering in their names, or by clicking the box and selecting them from the list.

7. **Set Geofence Center**:

   - **Click on the Map**: Use your mouse to click on the location where you want the center of the geofence to be.

   - **Use Geolocate**: Alternatively, you can use the geolocate function (usually represented as a compass or location icon) to zoom into your current location and set it as the geofence center.

8. **Click Save**: After configuring all settings, click the "Save" button to finalize and create the new geofence.
