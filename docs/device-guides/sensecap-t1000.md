8. **Configure for Trackpac**:

   - Change the platform to 'Other Platform.'
   - Note down the `dev_eui` for later use.
   - Update the `APP_EUI` to our recommended value: 545241434B504143 - if you ever want to change it back, a reset will restore the orignal keys
   - Lastly, copy the `app_key`.

   > Note: `dev_eui`, `app_eui`, and `app_key` are essential for adding the device to Trackpac.

9. **Additional Settings**:

   - **Work Mode Tab**: Set the heartbeat interval and enable various sensors and modes. 'Event Mode' is particularly useful, we like to set movement detection and movement ended.
