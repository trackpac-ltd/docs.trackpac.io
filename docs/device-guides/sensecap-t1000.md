2. **Initial Login**: Upon opening the app, you can log in or opt to skip by clicking 'Skip' at the top-right corner.

3. **Enter Configuration Mode**: A prompt will ask if you wish to enter Bluetooth configuration mode. Click 'Resume' or 'Yes.'

4. **Choose Your Device**: From the list of supported sensors, select 'Tracker T1000.'

5. **Enable Pairing Mode**: Follow the on-screen instructions to enable pairing mode. Hold down the button on your T1000 for 15 seconds until you hear a chime if you haven't turned it on yet.

6. **Scan for Tracker**: Click 'Setup' to initiate a scan for your device. Once found, tap on your device to select it.

7. **View Device Information**: This screen will display details like firmware version. Navigate to the 'Settings' tab at the top right.

8. **Configure for Trackpac**:

   - Change the platform to 'Other Platform.'
   - Note down the `dev_eui` for later use.
   - Update the `APP_EUI` to our recommended value: XYZ
   - Lastly, copy the `app_key`.

   > Note: `dev_eui`, `app_eui`, and `app_key` are essential for adding the device to Trackpac.

9. **Additional Settings**:

   - **Work Mode Tab**: Set the heartbeat interval and enable various sensors and modes. 'Event Mode' is particularly useful, we like to set movement detection and movement ended.
   - **Geolocation Tab**: Choose 'WiFi+GNSS' for optimal location tracking in sync with Trackpacâ€™s WiFi location engine, this can extend the battery life of the device.

10. **Save Settings**: Click 'Send' at the bottom to save your changes.
